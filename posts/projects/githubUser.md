## Overview

Github User App is an app that can display a list of Github users and their details. This app is made using Android Native(Java) and uses the Github API to get the data.

## The Problem

This app is made to fulfill the final project of the Dicoding Academy "Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Android" course. The problem is that I have to make an app that can get data from the API and display it in the app.
