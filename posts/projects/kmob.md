## Overview

KMOB App is an attendance reminder message application via Whatsapp that helps employees who forget to take attendance. Admin can create, read, update and delete contact lists and send reminder messages to all numbers on the contact list and employees can take attendance.

## The Problem

There can be several reasons why an employee might forget to take attendance. One of them is because they are too busy with their work. And the other reason is because they are too lazy to take attendance. And this is a problem for an employee because they will get a salary deduction if they forget to take attendance.

## The User & Audience

As i mentioned above, the main goal of the site is to help employees to take attendance. So the user of this app is an admin and an employee who works at Inspektorat Jabar.

## Role & Responsibility

I was responsible for creating all the features in this app. I also responsible for creating backend API for this app.
