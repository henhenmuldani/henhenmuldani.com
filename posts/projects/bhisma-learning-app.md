## Overview

Bhisma Learning App is an app that can make you learn from anywhere and anytime. Teacher, student, and parent can use this app. Teacher can make a material and quiz for student. Student can learn from the material and do the quiz. Parent can monitor their child's progress.

## The Problem

Covid-19 pandemic has changed the way we learn. We can't go to school and learn like usual. We need to learn from home. But, not all school has a good system to make their student learn from home. So, we need a system that can make student learn from home.

## The User & Audience

As i mentioned above, the main goal of the site is to help student to learn from home. So the user of this app is a teacher, student, and parent.

## Role & Responsibility

I was responsible for creating all the features in this android app like login, register, create material, create quiz, do quiz, etc. But i didn't create the backend API for this app. I only consume the API.
