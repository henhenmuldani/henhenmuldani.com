**Client**: Personal website

**Year**: 2023

**Tech Stacks**: Next.js(Typescript), MDX, TailwindCSS, Notion-API, Vercel

## Overview

henhenmuldani.com is my personal website that I made to showcase my portfolio and my blog(still development). This website is made using Next.js(Typescript), TailwindCSS, MDX, and Notion-API. I use MDX to write my portofolio posts and I use Notion-API to store data from my message form at my website. This website is hosted on Vercel.

## The Problem

I dont have a personal website to showcase my portfolio and my blog. So I decided to make one. I want to make a website that is easy to maintain and cheap to host.
