## Overview

A movie catalogue app is a mobile application that allows users to explore and access a vast collection of movies and related information. This app get information from The Movie Database (TMDb) API. Users can dorganize their favorite films into a list.

## The Problem

This app is made to fulfill the final project of the Dicoding Academy "Belajar Android Jetpack Pro" course. The problem is that I have to make an app that can get data from the API and display it in the app.
